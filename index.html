        <p class="MAB-Text">More About Me</p>
  </h2>
    <p class="large-about">As a child, I enjoyed playing a variety of video games, including Minecraft, Roblox, and Fortnite. Around late 2016 or early 2017, I became interested in creating my own games. I started with Roblox Studio and later explored Unity, but I didn't find the success I was hoping for. I then took a break, had fun playing games, and even built a gaming YouTube channel for a while. However, I eventually discovered a passion for web development and learned to create websites using HTML and CSS. This interest later shifted to finance, and I briefly considered a career in accounting. Despite these changes, my enthusiasm for game development returned. I returned to creating games on Roblox, investing more time and effort into them with some more success. Although this phase was relatively short-lived, my interest in programming remained constant. In August of 2022, I reignited my passion for programming, and in early 2023, I re-discovered my love for business and entrepreneurship. Currently, I am focused on starting a business.
