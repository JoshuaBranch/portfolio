  <h1 class="Projects_Heading">Joshua's Projects</h1>
    <p>Here is a page dedicated the some of the projects that I created. These will be from High school all the way to current times. Most of the projects will be on my GitHub page where you can see all of them I have uploaded. This page is mainly dedicated to the main projects that I have done and I'm currently working on.
    </p>
    <p>I can't guarantee that all of the projects will be working as intended as these range from different years and things might change as time goes on. Also, some of the code might be removed for privacy/security reasons. If that is the case, there will be a comment of what was changed/removed.

    <h2>Game Maker Projects</h2>
    <p>This is a place where I put my different games I created on Game Maker. When I created these games, there were different rules I had to follow such as, there must be 2 playable levels, the characters must be animated, there hase to be a win/lose condition, etc... 
    </p>
    <p>What's game maker?</p>
    <p>GameMaker is a series of cross-platform game engines created by Mark Overmars in 1999 and developed by YoYo Games since 2007. [Wikipedia]

    <h2>Website For My High School</h2>
    <p>My High School was unique. It was different from the traditional semester long classes. Instead it was a total of 8 terms per school year. This means we took a lot of classes. We also got to choose what classes we wanted to take as long as the teacher was offereing it. However, it was time consuming to do that. There for I decided to create a website which would make that process much easier.
    </p>
    <p>The only problem with that is I wasn't skilled enought to make it happen. The farthest I got was creating the website using HTML, CSS, and a bit of Java Script. What you see on the GitHub is how far I managed to make it with the skill I had.
